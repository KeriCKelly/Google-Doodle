# My Topic Google Doodle

My Google Doodle is based off of the 1980’s Disney film “The Last Unicorn”. The sets are very whimsical with soft blues and purples. I wanted to showcase the fairytale softness in the google doodle as well as the main character herself. I chose an old serif font that had a few embellishments. This was inspired by the old-style serif fonts used in the movie. I wanted it to be bold so that I could add some magical gems to the font. To excite the children that get to interact with this doodle, I made the unicorn interactive. If you click her ear, hoof or head, she will do something interesting that will bring a little magic into the simple design. Originally I was going to make the unicorn turn into Lady Almeria, but I ran out of time. I hope to continue the project in portfolio.
